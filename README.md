## 🚀 Quick Start: Integrate Your Automation Project

### Step 1: Create Your Account

1. **Sign up** at the dashboard (contact: info@digital-solution.co.il for access)
2. **Your organization is created automatically**
3. **You're the admin** - invite team members via Settings → Team Members

### Step 2: Get Your API Credentials

1. Login to the dashboard
2. Navigate to **Settings → Security**
3. Copy your **API URL** and **JWT Token** (after login)

### Step 3: Configure Your Test Project

The platform works with **any containerized test framework**. Here's how to integrate:

#### Option A: Use the API Directly

Send test execution requests to the API:

```bash
curl -X POST https://api.automation.keinar.com/api/execution-request \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_JWT_TOKEN" \
  -d '{
    "taskId": "run-'$(date +%s)'",
    "image": "mcr.microsoft.com/playwright:v1.40.0",
    "command": "npx playwright test",
    "folder": "tests/e2e",
    "config": {
      "environment": "staging",
      "baseUrl": "https://staging.automation.keinar.com"
    }
  }'
```

#### Option B: Integrate with CI/CD

**GitHub Actions Example:**

```yaml
name: Run E2E Tests
on: [push]

jobs:
  test:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v3

      - name: Trigger Tests on Agnostic Platform
        run: |
          curl -X POST ${{ secrets.AUTOMATION_API_URL }}/api/execution-request \
            -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
            -H "Authorization: Bearer ${{ secrets.AUTOMATION_JWT_TOKEN }}" \
            -d '{
              "taskId": "ci-run-${{ github.run_id }}",
              "image": "mcr.microsoft.com/playwright:v1.40.0",
              "command": "npm test",
              "folder": "tests",
              "config": {
                "environment": "production",
                "baseUrl": "${{ secrets.PROD_URL }}"
              }
            }'
```

**GitLab CI Example:**

```yaml
e2e-tests:
  stage: test
  script:
    - |
      curl -X POST $AUTOMATION_API_URL/api/execution-request \
        -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
        -H "Authorization: Bearer $AUTOMATION_JWT_TOKEN" \
        -d '{
          "taskId": "gitlab-'$CI_PIPELINE_ID'",
          "image": "cypress/included:13.6.0",
          "command": "cypress run",
          "folder": "cypress/e2e",
          "config": {
            "environment": "staging"
          }
        }'
```

#### Option C: Node.js Integration

```javascript
const axios = require('axios');

async function runTests() {
  const response = await axios.post(
    'https://api.automation.keinar.com/api/execution-request',
    {
      taskId: `run-${Date.now()}`,
      image: 'mcr.microsoft.com/playwright:v1.40.0',
      command: 'npx playwright test',
      folder: 'tests/integration',
      config: {
        environment: 'staging',
        baseUrl: 'https://staging.automation.keinar.com',
      },
    },
    {
      headers: {
        'Content-Type': 'application/json',
        'Authorization': `Bearer ${process.env.AUTOMATION_JWT_TOKEN}`,
      },
    }
  );

  console.log('Test execution started:', response.data.taskId);
}

runTests();
```

### Step 4: Monitor Test Execution

1. **Live Dashboard:** Watch tests execute in real-time at the dashboard
2. **WebSocket Updates:** See logs stream live via Socket.io
3. **AI Analysis:** If tests fail, AI automatically analyzes root cause
4. **Reports:** Access HTML and Allure reports via the dashboard
