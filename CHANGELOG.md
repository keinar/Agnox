## [1.1.0] — 2026-02-22

### Added
- **Test Case Repository** — `test_cases` MongoDB collection with full CRUD API (`POST/GET/PUT/DELETE /api/test-cases`) and AI-powered bulk step generation via Google Gemini
- **Test Cases Page** (`TestCases.tsx`) — Suite-grouped accordion view with search, project selector, and `TestCaseDrawer.tsx` for creating/editing test cases
- **Hybrid Cycle Builder** — `test_cycles` MongoDB collection, `POST/GET /api/test-cycles`, `CycleBuilderDrawer.tsx` for composing manual + automated cycles with suite-grouped checkbox selection
- **Test Cycles Page** (`TestCycles.tsx`) — Cycle listing with expandable item detail rows, status badges, automation rate progress bars, and pass/fail counters
- **Manual Execution Player** (`ManualExecutionDrawer.tsx`) — Interactive step-by-step checklist with Pass/Fail/Skip buttons per step, progress bar, auto-advance, and "Complete Test" button
- **Manual Item Update Endpoint** — `PUT /api/test-cycles/:cycleId/items/:itemId` using MongoDB `arrayFilters` for efficient nested updates, with automatic cycle summary recalculation
- **Automated Cycle Sync** — Worker forwards `cycleId`/`cycleItemId` from RabbitMQ task payloads; Producer syncs cycle item status on terminal execution results and auto-completes cycles
- **Sidebar Navigation** — Added "Test Cases" (ClipboardList icon) and "Test Cycles" (Layers icon) entries
- **Routes** — `/test-cases` and `/test-cycles` routes registered in `App.tsx`
